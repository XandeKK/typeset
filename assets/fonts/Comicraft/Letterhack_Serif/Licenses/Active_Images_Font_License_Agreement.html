<h1>Active Images Font License Agreement</h1><p>Please read this license agreement carefully before you install your fonts. By installing fonts sent to you by ACTIVE IMAGES, you accept this license agreement. If you do not accept the terms and conditions of this license, do not install the fonts in question.</p>
<p>1. LICENSE Active Images is the exclusive owner of the electronically transferred computer lettering fonts. We grant you, and you accept, a non-exclusive license to use the electronically transferred fonts, but you are not the owner of them. Your right to use the fonts under this license agreement is called the license. By fonts, we refer to the electronically transferred fonts and any embodiment or use that you make of the fonts in any form.</p>
<p>2. AUTHORIZED USER AND USE You alone, as the purchaser of the fonts, are authorised to use the fonts under the license for personal, business or distributed projects. With few exceptions: fonts are licensed for use on 5 CPUs and/or 1 output device. Additional licenses are available on a ratio of 5 CPUs to 1 output device. Call us if you are not clear on whether you require additional licenses. Any other duplication or use by any other person or entity constitutes software piracy, a criminal offense.</p>
<p>3. LIMITED WARRANTY Active Images makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding the electronically transferred computer software, its merchantability or its fitness for any particular purpose.</p>
<p>Active Images warrants the magnetic media to be free from physical defects for 90 days, after purchase. Active Images will replace the disk free of charge should it fail within this time. These fonts are sold for use only on the computer platform indicated on the packaging. Use of these fonts on any platform other than that for which it was originally intended is not recommended and invalidates any warranty.</p>
<p>Active Images reserves the right to terminate this License at any time and void your license if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this License.</p>
